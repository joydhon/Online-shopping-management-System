Hello viewers, 
This project will be great project for those who are making first time project using java swing and sql oracle. And i made it as much as possible to easy for understand my project. If you want to run this project first you have to check jar file has included or not in project library, if not please add jar file in library. Don't worry for that jar files because i included this jar files in this. then if you doesn't have oracle sql please install it. When installation and setting complete then open sql command prompt to create table. Don't worry for that also because i included this all codes as a .doc file. You have to just copy and past in the sql command prompt. And the whole project is very interesting when you can do all of this. The most interesting matter is that the whole project i made with using only JFrames. Admin login: username=joy and password=1234. If you dont understand or can't open it please message or comment me. I will give you answer as much as possible or soon. Thank you
